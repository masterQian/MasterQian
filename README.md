# MasterQian
 MasterQian C++ Library for Windows

You need to use a C++20 compiler.

When writing code, you only need to include the corresponding header file to easily use the MasterQian library.

Just carry the corresponding DLL file during runtime, pay attention to the Debug and Release versions. There is no need to use the lib static library to indicate the export name, as this process is dynamically loaded.
